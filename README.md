# Luna ML project

Luna project provides a leaderboard for ML models, and more to enable faster ML model development iterations. ML leaderboard keeps metadata and metrics of your ML models and their scores. So your team can find problems to work on and get informations about how they have been evolved. Planned components are

 - Leaderboard: List ML models based on score, for each project
 - Scoring system: Score submitted ML model statically or dynamically
 - Project statistics: Provides insight of each project, their historical score evolution
 - Integration to model serving (second phase): Trigger and get status information from your ML model serving infra


Here's preview of the UI.
